    "# Heart failure outcome classifier\n",
    "In this notebook we will take a dive into a [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asgharalikhan/mortality-rate-heart-patient-pakistan-hospital) dataset of heart failures in Pakistan.  \n",
    "While I am **not** a medical professional and know only slightly more about heart failures than an average person, I will try to create a model, that will predict the mortality of a heart failure in the Pakistani settings. This model might not work to predict the mortality in other countries, which are more or less medically advanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Disclaimer!** This is not a medical study nor recommendation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How will it work?\n",
    "With hypothesis testing, I will determine, which of the features of the patients attribute to the heart failure the most to mortality. Having the best features selected, I will create a model, that will predict the mortality for the given sample of patients. Once the model is created with best possible scores, I will check and determine, which of the features impact mortality the most. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How is this model useful?\n",
    "Knowing the most crucial features that might contribute to fatal heart failure, users of this model might check if in their current health, would they survive a heart failure in Pakistan. In another setting, if the model predicts fatality, whils the user is alive, it might be a suggestion to consult with their doctor the state of their health, to avoid heart failure in the future - this aspect might be useful in any different settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good to know\n",
    "Data analized in this study does not touch on the accessability to the hospital or a doctor, time of diagnosis, CPR occurrecne and duration, threatment, how long did it take for the patient to receive firts aid, how far were they from the nearest hospital, chronic diseases, etc. While the dataset gives a good insight on the patients parameters, many life-saving aspects are not included, therefore any conclusions, especially resulting in death on a user of this model should not be taken too seriously. These might however suggest to schedule a check-up with the users doctor.\n",
